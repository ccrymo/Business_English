Now, a company called JapanRail is offering a train trip from Paris to Tokyo. The journey takes sixty days and costs $5,000. Passengers visit 15 countries along the way. The trip includes stops in Germany, Russia, and China. There are many things to see during the journey. Travelers can visit the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, and Mount Fuji. The first train left Paris in June 2024. People of all ages bought tickets for the trip. The youngest passenger is 20 years old, and the oldest is 75. Mr. Tanaka is the owner of JapanRail.
